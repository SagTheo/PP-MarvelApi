# PP-MarvelApi

This project will make use of an API (https://developer.marvel.com/)
    --> Goal here is to use and play around with fetch requests


Difficulties encountered:
    -figuring out how API requests work
    -aligning vertically the marker of a list item and its text
        -sorted out: dynamically included the marker as an icon in an img tag, then used the 
                     'vertical-align' property with the value 'top' to align the text with the icon
